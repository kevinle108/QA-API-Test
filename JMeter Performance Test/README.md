## Subject: [Svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/)

7 Routes Tested:
- /

### [Click to go to HTML Report generated by JMeter](https://kevinle108.github.io/jmeter-report/)

## Findings
 Two of the routes, "/tutorial" and "/repl", made their own network requests that were logged by JMeter as seen in the graph below:
![table](https://github.com/kevinle108/QA-API-Test/blob/main/JMeter%20Performance%20Test/jmeter-table.png)

Another notable finding is that all requests took approximately the same amount of time except for the "/docs" route as seen in the graph below:

But overall, the website performed well under load. Even with 16,500 total requests sent, none failed.
